# FormatBridge for Twine - Master Plan & Architecture

**FormatBridge** is an **automated story format converter** that translates Twine stories between different formats while preserving functionality and intent.

### Primary Objective

Create a **reliable, intelligent converter** that:
1. Parses source format syntax into format-agnostic Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
2. Analyzes semantic meaning of code
3. Generates equivalent code in target format
4. Validates conversion correctness
5. Reports lossy conversions and manual fixes needed
